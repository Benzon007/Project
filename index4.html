				<p class="description1">A greenhouse gas (GHG or GhG) is a gas that absorbs and emits radiant energy at thermal infrared wavelengths, causing the greenhouse effect.<br>
                [1] The primary greenhouse gases in Earth's atmosphere are water vapor (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and ozone (O3). Without greenhouse gases, the average temperature of Earth's surface would be about −18 °C (0 °F),<br>
                [2] rather than the present average of 15 °C (59 °F).[3][4][5] The atmospheres of Venus, Mars and Titan also contain greenhouse gases.[6] .</p><br>
                <p class="description1">Carbon dioxide is the most significant greenhouse gas, accounting for about 75% of total greenhouse gas emissions. It is produced by burning fossil fuels for energy, transportation, and industrial processes.<br>
                 Methane is the second most significant greenhouse gas, accounting for about 16% of total emissions. It is produced by natural sources such as wetlands and livestock, as well as human activities such as agriculture and fossil fuel production.</p><br>
                <p class="description1" >Nitrous oxide accounts for about 6% of total greenhouse gas emissions and is primarily produced by agricultural practices such as fertilizer use and livestock manure management.<br>
                 Fluorinated gases are synthetic gases that are used in a variety of industrial applications and account for about 3% of total greenhouse gas emissions.</p><br>
                <p class="description1" >Reducing greenhouse gas emissions is essential for mitigating the impacts of climate change. Strategies for reducing emissions include increasing energy efficiency, transitioning to renewable energy sources, improving agricultural practices, and reducing waste.<br>
                 Additionally, carbon capture and storage technologies can be used to capture carbon dioxide emissions from industrial processes and store them underground.

				<p class="description1">Gases that cause global warming have a long history. Gases that trap heat have always been in the Earth's atmosphere, keeping the planet's temperature within a range that supports life. <br>
                The Earth would be far colder without greenhouse gases, and there wouldn't be life as we know it.</p><br>
                <p class="description1">Yet since the Industrial Revolution, which started in the late 18th century, human activities have dramatically raised the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. <br>
                Carbon dioxide has been released into the atmosphere in massive quantities as a result of the burning of fossil fuels including coal, oil, and gas, which has led to a sharp rise in the gas's concentration.</p><br>
                <p class="description1" >Research on greenhouse gases began in the 19th century, when scientists realised how important these gases were in preserving the Earth's temperature.<br>
                 Scientists like Svante Arrhenius started looking at the possible effects of human activity on climate change at the turn of the 20th century.</p><br>
                <p class="description1" >The scientific agreement about the contribution of greenhouse gases to climate change crystallised throughout the second half of the 20th century. <br>
                The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was created in 1988 with the mission of evaluating climate change research and advising countries on appropriate action.
